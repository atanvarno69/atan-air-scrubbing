# Air Scrubbing

Adds air scrubbing to remove pollution and spores.

Technology is provided to unlock the air scrubber building and pollution filters to use with it. The air scrubber will consume 1 pollution filter and remove 40 pollution in 60 seconds. This produces a used pollution filter, which may be cleaned to recover all or most of the pollution filters and has a chance to return a filtered byproduct.

### Recipes

* By player or in assembling machine: 2 s + 5 iron gear wheel + 3 electronic circuit + 2 steel plate + 2 efficiency module → 1 air scrubber
* By player or in assembling machine: 2 s + 2 coal [carbon with Space Age] + 1 steel plate + 1 plastic bar → 1 pollution filter
* In air scrubber: 60 s + 1 pollution filter - 40 pollution → 1 used pollution filter
* In chemical plant or biochamber: 20 s + 10 used pollution filter + 300 water → 8-10 pollution filter + 10% 0-3 sulfur

With Space Age:

* By player or in assembling machine: 2 s + 2 carbon + 1 steel plate + 1 plastic bar → 1 spore filter
* In air scrubber: 60 s + 1 spore filter - 40 spores → 1 used spore filter
* In chemical plant or biochamber: 20 s + 10 used spore filter + 300 water → 8-10 spore filter + 10% 0-3 spoilage
